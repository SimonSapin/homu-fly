# Example deployment of Homu on Fly.io

What is Homu: https://bors.tech/homu-io/

[Rust’s fork](https://github.com/rust-lang/homu) is the most maintained,
though [Servo’s fork](https://github.com/servo/homu) has also evolved separately
and got a few features (such as dry-running a selected subset of CI with “try choosers”).

Fly.io’s free allowance looks more than enough for hosting Homu:
